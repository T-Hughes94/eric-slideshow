      Thanks for taking the time to visit my page!
      I'm Eric and have been a business-to-business consultant for almost 20 years. For the last 8 years I have helped businesses with efficiency and maximization of their business equipment. I'm a proud Hockey Dad and spend many hours at the rinks supporting my son's pursuit of their dreams. Originally from Denver, Colorado, I was drawn to the beauty and friendly nature of the people on the North Shore and relocated my family here in 2013.

          As a former business owner, I've seen the cost, time, and effort it takes to deal with a subpar/mismatched copier. 
          If I had only known Managed Print Services existed and there were Consultants who could help me, I would have signed up immediately.

          There is no cost to get an audit and suggestions for improving the systems you have in place. I believe it's priority #1 for an owner/executive to work on their business instead of working in their business. 
          Growth is a mindset... let me take some of the operational clutter off your plate.
