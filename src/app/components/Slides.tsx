      Thanks for taking the time to visit my page!
      I'm Eric and have been a business-to-business consultant for almost 20 years. 
      For the last 8 years I have helped businesses with efficiency and maximization of their business equipment. 
      I'm a proud Hockey Dad and spend many hours at the rinks supporting my son's pursuit of their dreams. 
      Originally from Denver, Colorado, I was drawn to the beauty and friendly nature of the people on the North Shore and relocated my family here in 2013.
